                    <p>
                        Landslide is one of the major hazards, widely spread in hilly regions of India and accounts for
                        huge loss of lives
                        and damage to highways/roads network, human settlements, agricultural fields, and other natural
                        resources.
                        Landslides are among those hazards which have affected the Indian Territory, especially the
                        Himalayan region.

                        landslide disaster
                        events which took heavy toll on lives and properties.
